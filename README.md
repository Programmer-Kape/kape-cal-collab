This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# What's this all about?

A couple of suggestions brought up this project where the KapeVSC community can practice and contribute using their web technology skills by developing a simple application.

# This Project

A simple calendar application that allows our discord community members to use it to record meaningful events, notes, and other things that they need to record of data on a particular date and time.

# Requirements

As a user, I want to be able to record my data in a chornological order using calendar grid system so that I could easily recall and share to others what happened on a particular date and time.

## Acceptance Criteria

- users should be able to enter a title and a description box that accepts markdown syntax together with their server discord nickname
- users should be able to filter out only their own calendar entries by remembering their discord nickname when they load the page; this will also display all shared entries by other users
- first time access of the page should prompt the user of their discord server nickname
- user should be able to search their entries by the title and the text from the description box
- user should be able to share their entries to a set of other users based off their discord server nicknames

# The Stack

The project as initialized using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) instructions and push it into the organization's Github repository. This is expected to be developed using Full Stack React with server side functions.

# Become a Contributor

If you want to contribute to this project, checkout the git [repository](https://github.com/Programmer-Kape/kape-cal-collab) and start coding. Contact **@psycotrompus** from the discord server if you need further assistenace. He's currently acting as the project lead.

If you want to push your changes, do so with careful consideration of other contributor's work. Always `fetch` and `pull` the latest commits first before pushing yours.

**Happy Coding!**
